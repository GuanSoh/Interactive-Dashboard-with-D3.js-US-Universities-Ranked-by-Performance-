# Interactive-Dashboard-with-D3.js-US-Universities-Ranked-by-Performance-

## Introduction

A tertiary education is regarded as of utmost importance for students in the United States. Hence, enlisting into a credible and reputable university requires an intensive amount of research and sometimes we do not even know what we are looking for in a university. This project aims to aid potential students in selecting the right university for them, by allowing them to look through the ratings given to the university in the past years. A standardized scoring method looks into a combination of five different ratings to see which university excels in which metric, such as international appeal (inter outlook rating) to the number of times a work from that particular university is credited and used (citation rating).
